Hi! 👋 , my name is Peter Yoo, Korean-American, and I reside in ☀️ Los Angeles. I'm transitioning careers from Art ➡️ Tech. I started this journey back in March 2022 when I was first introduced to JavaScript and haven't stopped running since. I am always open to feedback on any of my projects and I want to learn as much as possible. Feel free to contact me anytime @ [petersyoox@gmail.com](petersyoox@gmail.com) and check out my [portfolio](https://petersyoo.netlify.app/) and [blog](https://peters-blog.vercel.app/).
